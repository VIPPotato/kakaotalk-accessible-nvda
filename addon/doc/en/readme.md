# KakaoTalk Accessibility Enhancements

## What this add-on does
KakaoTalk uses custom list controls that can cause NVDA to keep focus on the list container instead of the selected item. This add-on improves accessibility by ensuring list items (Contacts, Chats, message lists) are announced correctly as you move through them.

## Installation
1. Download the latest `.nvda-addon` from the GitHub Releases page.
2. Open the file and confirm installation in NVDA.
3. Restart NVDA when prompted.

## Usage
No configuration is required. Navigate KakaoTalk lists with the arrow keys and NVDA should announce the currently selected item.

## Troubleshooting
- If items still aren’t announced, confirm you’re using a supported NVDA version (see Add-on Information in NVDA).
- When reporting bugs, include your NVDA version, KakaoTalk version, and a copy of the NVDA log (set logging to “Debug” if needed).
